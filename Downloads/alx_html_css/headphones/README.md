# Headphones Website Project

## Project Overview
This project involves building a fully responsive and accessible landing page for a headphones product, based entirely on a provided Figma design.  
The page will be developed from scratch using **HTML5** and **CSS3**, following semantic and accessibility best practices.

## Design Reference (Figma)
The design is provided in Figma and includes both **desktop** and **mobile** versions.  
Steps taken:
1. Created a free Figma account.
2. Opened the provided link to the design file.
3. Duplicated the design to my Drafts for inspection.
4. Reviewed all design specifications, including:
   - Fonts: **Source Sans Pro** and **Spin Cycle OT**.
   - Color palette and gradients.
   - Layout structure (desktop & mobile breakpoints).
   - Padding, margins, and spacing.
   - Button styles, hover effects, and icon placement.
5. Will strictly follow these specifications during implementation.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 (Semantic Structure)
- CSS3 (Responsive Design, Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)
- Figma (Design Reference)

## Accessibility
The site will be:
- Fully navigable using a keyboard.
- Labeled with appropriate ARIA attributes where necessary.
- Designed with sufficient contrast ratios.

## Features to Implement
- Hero section with a background image and call-to-action button.
- “What we do” services section.
- “Our results” section with animated elements.
- Contact form with accessible labels and placeholders.
- Fully responsive layout adapting to all screen sizes.

## Responsive Design
- **Mobile-first** approach.
- Uses `@media` queries for larger breakpoints.
- Elements adapt fluidly to different screen widths.

## Live Demo
Once completed, a GitHub Pages link will be added here.
